		****It is a simple Game to improve your typing efficiency**** 

Following are key objectives:
> number of correct keystrokes
> number of incorrect keystrokes
> time taken for each correct keystroke
> total uptime taken for the practice
> calculate successful key press percentage

so in total pretty good mathematical functions are used behind the scene;

UI will be developed using Angular and will be aligned with this project
use some pretty good BG and data should be popped in a clean fashion;


To Do:
> Design the code base and backend for the system neatly;
> Login Data should be secured with Authentication protocol or APIs used in Market for sign in
> check possibilities for single sign on and all;
> May be later the project should be converted to Spring maven or Gradle based, to use their ease and features;
> The same project can be developed using different logics, so implement it in different ways;
